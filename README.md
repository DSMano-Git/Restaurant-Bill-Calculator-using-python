**Description:**
This Python project is designed to help beginner developers practice their skills by building a simple program that calculates the cost of a lunch at a restaurant, including tip, and divides the total cost by the number of people in a group.

**Features:**
Total Bill Input: Allows the user to input the total bill amount for a meal.
Tip Calculation: Prompts the user to enter a tip percentage (commonly 10%, 12%, or 15%).
Number of People: Allows the user to specify the number of people splitting the bill.
Total Calculation: Computes the total amount to be paid (bill + tip).
Per Person Calculation: Calculates the amount each person needs to pay by dividing the total amount by the number of people.
How It Works:

The user is prompted to input the total bill amount.
The user is asked for the tip percentage (e.g., 10%, 12%, or 15%).
The script calculates the tip based on the given percentage.
The total amount (bill + tip) is calculated.
The script divides the total by the number of people to find out how much each person should pay.
The total bill (including tip) and the amount per person are displayed.
Example: If the total bill is $100, the tip percentage is 15%, and there are 4 people:

Total bill (including tip): $115
Each person has to pay: $28.75

**Usage:** Simply run the script, and enter the required information when prompted. The calculator will give you the total amount, including tip, and the amount each person needs to pay.
